About Py4J
==========

Py4J is developed by `Barthélémy Dagenais <http://bart.prologique.com>`_. The goal is to enable developers to program in Python and benefit
from easy to use libraries such as `lxml <http://codespeak.net/lxml/>`_ while being able to reuse useful Java libraries
and frameworks such as `PPA <http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/ppa/>`_ and `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org>`_.
